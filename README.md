Scrapes articles from news websites with Cheerio and generates article summaries with OpenAI. Node and Express used to expose API for server-side scraping and summary generation.

The live site is hosted with Render's free tier web service, which will require some time to spin up. The low RAM and CPU allocated in the free tier will also cause unusually long load times. Alternatively, you can run this project locally on your PC:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/obdwinston/news-scraper.git` to clone this repository.
2. Create `.env` file in root folder and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Run `npm run local` from root folder.
