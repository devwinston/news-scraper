Scrapes articles from news websites with Cheerio and Axios, and generates article summaries with OpenAI. Node and Express used to expose API for server-side scraping and summary generation.

Of note, the Render web service is the free tier, hence the live site may require some time to spin up after some inactivity. Also, the allocated RAM and CPU in the free tier may cause unusually long load times. Another option is to run this project locally on your PC:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/obdwinston/news-scraper.git` to clone this repository.
2. Create `.env` file in root folder and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Run `npm run local` from root folder.
